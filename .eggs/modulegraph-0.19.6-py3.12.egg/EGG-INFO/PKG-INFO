modulegraph
===========

modulegraph determines a dependency graph between Python modules primarily
by bytecode analysis for import statements.

modulegraph uses similar methods to modulefinder from the standard library,
but uses a more flexible internal representation, has more extensive
knowledge of special cases, and is extensible.

Release history
===============

Version 0.19.6
--------------

* Actually introduce Python 3.12 support

  Previous support was tested on an installation that previously
  had an early alpha installed without cleaning up, resulting in
  failing to remove all use of the ``imp`` module.

0.19.5
------

* Sigh.. Actually fix 2.7 support

  (code cleanup broke the PR in 0.19.4)

0.19.4
------

* Fix broken python 2.7 support

  PR by Josua Root

* Initial support for Python 3.12

  The changes to support Python 3.12 are a bit rough,
  tests pass but I'm not 100% convinced the changes
  are correct.

0.19.3
------

* Fix incompatibility with Python 3.11

0.19.2
------

* Fix project links in PyPI sidebar


0.19.1
------

* Explictly mention python 3.10 support in package metadata

0.19
----

* Fix incorrect path when package ``__init__`` is an extension.

0.18
----

* Avoid exception when one of the items on "packages" is not a package
  (modulegraph.find_modules.find_needed_modules)

* #45: ``Modulegraph.foldReferences()`` called the wrong method

  Reported by Anthony Foglia.

0.17
----

* The .pyc format changed a little in Python 3.7

0.16
----

Features:

* Add LICENSE file to distribution

* Don't rely on pkg_resources to calculate package version

* Replace use of ``optparse`` by ``argparse`` as the former is deprecated

  Patch by htgoebel

* Attempt to reduce the maximum recursion needed to create the ModuleGraph

* Don't include the file type in the result from ``zipio.getmode``

* Fix mismatched indents/dedents in ModuleGraph debug output

  Patch by codewarrior0

Bug fixes:

* Testsuite now passes on Windows (testd through appveyor)

  This only required changes to remove platform dependencies
  from the test suite.

0.15
----

Features:

* Issue #39: Traceback with for a syntax error when compiling async function

  On Python 3.5 some (invalid) async function definitions caused a modulegraph
  traceback, instead of adding "InvalidSourceModule" nodes to the graph.

* Issue #40: The graph now contains nodes of type "InvalidRelativeImport" for
  attempts to use relative imports that walk outside of a toplevel
  package.

* Module ``modulegraph.find_modules`` can no longer be used a script,
  use ``python -m modulegraph`` instead.

Bugfixes:

* Issue 38: Dot output broken in Python 3

  Patch by user elnuno on bitbucket.

* Issue 36: Make sure test suite works on systems other than macOS

  Patch by Hartmut Goebel

* Add support for "async def" to the AST scanner, needed to
  properly recognize imports in async function definitions.

0.14
----

Bugfixes:

* #33: Error scanning bytecode on python 3.4 or later

  The code using ``dis.get_instructions`` to scan the bytecode
  on Python 3.4 or later didn't work properly causing problems
  when trying to scan bytecode.

0.13
----

* Various documentation fixes by Thomas Kluyver.

* Fix incompatibility with recent versions of setuptools

  See also `issue #206 in py2apps tracker <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/py2app/issues/206/py2app-doesnt-work-with-release-433-of>`_ for more information.

* Python 3: Ignore BOM at start of input files when compiling them.

  This matches the behavior of CPython, and avoids hard to diagnose problems.
  See also `issue #178 in the py2app tracker <https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/py2app/issues/178/python-3-syntaxerror-invalid-character-in>`_

* Python 3.6 introduced a new bytecode format (wordcode), adjust the
  bytecode scanner for that.


0.12.1
------

* Issue #25: Complex python files could cause an "maximum recursion depth exceeded"
  exception due to using stack-based recursion to walk the module AST.


0.12
----

* Added 'modulegraph.modulegraph.InvalidSourceModule'. This graph node is
  used for Python source modules that cannot be compiled (for example because
  they contain syntax errors).

  This is primarily useful for being able to create a graph for packages
  that have python 2.x or python 3.x compatibility in separate modules that
  contain code that isn't valid in the "other" python version.

* Added 'modulegraph.modulegraph.InvalidCompiledModule'. This graph node
  is used for Python bytecode modules that cannot be loaded.

* Added 'modulegraph.modulegraph.NamespacePackage'.

  Patch by bitbucket user htgoebel.

* No longer add a MissingModule node to the graph for 'collections.defaultdict'
  when using 'from collections import defaultdict' ('collections.defaultdict'
  is an attribute of 'collections', not a submodule).

* Fixed typo in ModuleGraph.getReferences()

* Added ModuleGraph.getReferers(tonode). This methods yields the
  nodes that are referencing *tonode* (the reverse of getReferences)

* The graph will no longer contain MissingModule nodes when using 'from ... import name' to
  import a global variable in a python module.

  There will still be MissingModule nodes for global variables in C extentions, and
  for 'from missing import name' when 'missing' is itself a MissingModule.

* Issue #18: Don't assume that a PEP 302 loader object has a ``path`` attribute. That
  attribute is not documented and is not always present.

0.11.2
------

*

0.11.1
------

* Issue #145: Don't exclude the platform specific 'path' modules (like ntpath)

0.11
----

This is a feature release

Features
........

* Hardcode knowlegde about the compatibility aliases in the email
  module (for python 2.5 upto 3.0).

  This makes it possible to remove a heavy-handed recipe from py2app.

* Added ``modegraph.zipio.getmode`` to fetch the Unix file mode
  for a file.

* Added some handy methods to ``modulegraph.modulegraph.ModuleGraph``.

0.10.5
------

This is a bugfix release

* Don't look at the file extension to determine the file type
  in modulegraph.find_modules.parse_mf_results, but use the
  class of the item.

* Issue #13: Improved handing of bad relative imports
  ("from .foo import bar"), these tended to raise confusing errors and
  are now handled like any other failed import.

0.10.4
------

This is a bugfix release

* There were no 'classifiers' in the package metadata due to a bug
  in setup.py.

0.10.3
------

This is a bugfix release

Bugfixes
........

* ``modulegraph.find.modules.parse_mf_results`` failed when the main script of
  a py2app module didn't have a file name ending in '.py'.

0.10.2
------

This is a bugfix release

Bugfixes
........

* Issue #12: modulegraph would sometimes find the wrong package *__init__*
  module due to using the wrong search method. One easy way to reproduce the
  problem was to have a toplevel module named *__init__*.

  Reported by Kentzo.

0.10.1
------

This is a bugfix release

Bugfixes
........

* Issue #11: creating xrefs and dotty graphs from modulegraphs (the --xref
  and --graph options of py2app) didn't work with python 3 due to use of
  APIs that aren't available in that version of python.

  Reported by Andrew Barnert.


0.10
----

This is a minor feature release

Features
........

* ``modulegraph.find_modules.find_needed_modules`` claimed to automaticly
  include subpackages for the "packages" argument as well, but that code
  didn't work at all.

* Issue #9: The modulegraph script is deprecated, use
  "python -mmodulegraph" instead.

* Issue #10: Ensure that the result of "zipio.open" can be used
  in a with statement (that is, ``with zipio.open(...) as fp``.

* No longer use "2to3" to support Python 3.

  Because of this modulegraph now supports Python 2.6
  and later.

* Slightly improved HTML output, which makes it easier
  to manipulate the generated HTML using JavaScript.

  Patch by anatoly techtonik.

* Ensure modulegraph works with changes introduced after
  Python 3.3b1.

* Implement support for PEP 420 ("Implicit namespace packages")
  in Python 3.3.

* ``modulegraph.util.imp_walk`` is deprecated and will be
  removed in the next release of this package.

Bugfixes
........

* The module graph was incomplete, and generated incorrect warnings
  along the way, when a subpackage contained import statements for
  submodules.

  An example of this is ``sqlalchemy.util``, the ``__init__.py`` file
  for this package contains imports of modules in that modules using
  the classic relative import syntax (that is ``import compat`` to
  import ``sqlalchemy.util.compat``). Until this release modulegraph
  searched the wrong path to locate these modules (and hence failed
  to find them).


0.9.2
-----

This is a bugfix release

Bugfixes
........

* The 'packages' option to modulegraph.find_modules.find_modules ignored
  the search path argument but always used the default search path.

* The 'imp_find_modules' function in modulegraph.util has an argument 'path',
  this was a string in previous release and can now also be a sequence.

* Don't crash when a module on the 'includes' list doesn't exist, but warn
  just like for missing 'packages' (modulegraph.find_modules.find_modules)

0.9.1
-----

This is a bugfix release

Bug fixes
.........

- Fixed the name of nodes imports in packages where the first element of
  a dotted name can be found but the rest cannot. This used to create
  a MissingModule node for the dotted name in the global namespace instead
  of relative to the package.

  That is, given a package "pkg" with submodule "sub" if the "__init__.py"
  of "pkg" contains "import sub.nomod" we now create a MissingModule node
  for "pkg.sub.nomod" instead of "sub.nomod".

  This fixes an issue with including the crcmod package in application
  bundles, first reported on the pythonmac-sig mailinglist by
  Brendan Simon.

0.9
---

This is a minor feature release


Features:

- Documentation is now generated using `sphinx <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx>`_
  and can be viewed at <http://packages.python.org/modulegraph>.

  The documention is very rough at this moment and in need of reorganisation and
  language cleanup. I've basiclly writting the current version by reading the code
  and documenting what it does, the order in which classes and methods are document
  is therefore not necessarily the most useful.

- The repository has moved to bitbucket

- Renamed ``modulegraph.modulegraph.AddPackagePath`` to ``addPackagePath``,
  likewise ``ReplacePackage`` is now ``replacePackage``. The old name is still
  available, but is deprecated and will be removed before the 1.0 release.

- ``modulegraph.modulegraph`` contains two node types that are unused and
  have unclear semantics: ``FlatPackage`` and ``ArchiveModule``. These node
  types are deprecated and will be removed before 1.0 is released.

- Added a simple commandline tool (``modulegraph``) that will print information
  about the dependency graph of a script.

- Added a module (``zipio``) for dealing with paths that may refer to entries
  inside zipfiles (such as source paths referring to modules in zipped eggfiles).

  With this addition ``modulegraph.modulegraph.os_listdir`` is deprecated and
  it will be removed before the 1.0 release.

Bug fixes:

- The ``__cmp__`` method of a Node no longer causes an exception
  when the compared-to object is not a Node. Patch by Ivan Kozik.

- Issue #1: The initialiser for ``modulegraph.ModuleGraph`` caused an exception
  when an entry on the path (``sys.path``) doesn't actually exist.

  Fix by "skurylo", testcase by Ronald.

- The code no longer worked with python 2.5, this release fixes that.

- Due to the switch to mercurial setuptools will no longer include
  all required files. Fixed by adding a MANIFEST.in file

- The method for printing a ``.dot`` representation of a ``ModuleGraph``
  works again.


0.8.1
-----

This is a minor feature release

Features:

- ``from __future__ import absolute_import`` is now supported

- Relative imports (``from . import module``) are now supported

- Add support for namespace packages when those are installed
  using option ``--single-version-externally-managed`` (part
  of setuptools/distribute)

0.8
---

This is a minor feature release

Features:

- Initial support for Python 3.x

- It is now possible to run the test suite
  using ``python setup.py test``.

  (The actual test suite is still fairly minimal though)
